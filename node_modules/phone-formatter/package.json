First, it can normalize pretty much any format you can throw at it. If it can't, then send a pull request with a failing test and it will (shortly thereafter).\n\n```javascript\nvar phoneFormatter = require('phone-formatter');\n\nphoneFormatter.normalize('212.555.1212');\n// returns \"2125551212\"\n\nphoneFormatter.normalize('+1 (212) 555-1212');\n// returns \"2125551212\"\n```\n\nYou get the idea. It can also format a series of ten digits into almost any format your heart desires. Use the letter \"N\" as a place holder.\n\n```javascript\nphoneFormatter.format(\"2125551212\", \"(NNN) NNN-NNNN\");\n// returns \"(212) 555-1212\"\n```\n\n### But I want to do both at the same time!\n\nThat's cool. Do it.\n\n```javascript\nphoneFormatter.format(\"(212) 555-1212\", \"NNN.NNN.NNNN\")\n// returns \"212.555.1212\"\n```\n\nIf for some reason, this is not what you want: you can turn it off.\n\n```javascript\nphoneFormatter.format(\"(212) 555-1212\", \"NNN.NNN.NNNN\", {normalize: false})\n// Will probably crash and burn hideously. What are you even doing?\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nAs it stands, there are only two methods, `normalize` and `format`. They are pretty much fleshed out above. That said, I'm reserving this second for future greatness.\n\nI can confirm that Phone Formatter can normalize the following formats.\n\n* (212) 555 1212\n* (212) 555.1212\n* (212) 555-1212\n* (212) 5551212\n* (212)5551212\n* 212 555 1212\n* 212.555.1212\n* 212-555-1212\n* 1-212-555-1212\n* +1 (212) 555-1212\n* 12125551212\n* +45 (212) 555-1212\n* 212555121\n\nIt may handle ever more, but I haven't tested it.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcome as long as they are accompanied by tests.\n\nRight now, this library is incredibly American-centric and that kind of stinks, but my use case consisted exclusively of American phone numbers. If you'd like to tweak Phone Formatter to better suit your situation, please do!\n\n**Brief Style Guide**: Two spaces, no space before function parentheses, semi-colons everywhere.\n\n## Release History\n\n* 0.0.2: Normalize phone numbers by default.\n* 0.0.1: Just two methods and some tests.\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2013 Steve Kinney  \nLicensed under the MIT license.\n",
